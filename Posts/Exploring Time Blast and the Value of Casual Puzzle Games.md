Today, I came across an interesting mention of the game "Time Blast" in the Deconstructor of Fun email, a variation on the match/blast puzzle genre. While researching, I noticed several discussions among game developers dismissing such games as "not real puzzles" and "not serious game development." So, I decided to dive deeper into this "casual" game, and I was pleasantly surprised.

As a game developer, I was impressed by the game's quality and how smoothly it runs, which speaks volumes about the challenges the developers likely overcame. The art and UI are exceptionally well done—vibrant, engaging, and a joy to interact with. The game design, too, stood out with its non-trivial mechanics that add depth to the genre.

Regarding the notion that these games are "not real games" and are "just made to make money," I strongly disagree. I've written before about how these games can be great for mental health. Even as a fan of hardcore puzzle games, I enjoy casual puzzles because they help my mind relax and combat stress. Moreover, these games bring new players into our community, fostering a positive attitude towards the gaming industry.

To my fellow developers working on casual, hypercasual, match-3 games, and more—you are doing real and important work. Don't let anyone undermine your efforts by claiming it's "only about the money." After all, there's nothing wrong with earning money—how else will you fund your dream game?
