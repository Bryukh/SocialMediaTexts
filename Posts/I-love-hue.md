I think everyone has own favorite stress relief game. Mediative relaxing games, hypercasual repetitive games, unhurried puzzles and many many more options. As for me I've tried many of them and two of them have settled on my mobile permanently. Well, I would say it's one game: I Love Hue and its sequel. 

I Love Hue is a calm puzzle for your perception. Arrange mosaics of coloured tiles into perfectly ordered spectrums. No time pressure, warm soft colors and soothing music. It's a perfect game to play before going to sleep or when you need to relax.
