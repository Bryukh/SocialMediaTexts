I'm shifting my focus more towards the web game project, specifically looking at 3D game engines that can run smoothly on Chromebooks. I'm considering Unity but not sure if it will be easy to optimize for Chromebooks. Other options on my mind are Godot and PlayCanvas.

Any recommendations or suggestions on which engine to use or what to keep in mind?
