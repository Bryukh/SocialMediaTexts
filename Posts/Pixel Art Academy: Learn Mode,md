Today, I'm excited to share a hidden gem that's a must-play for educators, game developers, artists, and dedicated gamers. I'm talking about Pixel Art Academy: Learn Mode, created by @Matej (Retro) Jan. This meditative game not only teaches you how to draw pixel art but also draws inspiration from iconic games while letting you create your own game assets! (Seriously, you've got to check out my awesome strawberry and Snakeskin for the Snake game!)
What truly sets Pixel Art Academy: Learn Mode apart is its user experience and atmosphere. It creates a serene, stress-free environment that's perfect for unwinding. It's like playing a relaxing game with the bonus of learning something valuable. Think of it as the Bob Ross of pixel art, where you're the artist in this interactive experience. Plus, if you're a retro art fan, you'll feel right at home. Pixel art is tough to master, and we can all see that from the flood of pixel games on Steamâ€”but this game offers a top-notch, fun way to actually learn it!
There's even a demo if you're unsure. As for me, I've been following the creator for a while, so I bought it instantly! ðŸ’¸
