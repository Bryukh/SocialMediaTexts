I recently revisited an 8-year-old article by Andrej Karpathy on "Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels." Despite its age and technical depth, it’s still a fantastic resource. Many AI articles today can feel a bit shallow, so if you're into game development and eager to understand the technical side of AI, this long read is definitely worth your time. It’s a deep dive for those who love figuring out the "how" behind AI systems.

Just revisited Andrej Karpathy’s 8-year-old article on AI and deep reinforcement learning using Pong. It’s still a goldmine for game devs wanting real technical insights on AI. It's worth the read if you’re into the “how it works” behind AI in games.
