When I mention Games+Education, people think that Game-based Learning and Gamification are the same.

There are a few critical differences between gamification and game-based learning. Gamification is using game mechanics and game design principles in non-game contexts. On the other hand, game-based learning uses games to teach specific educational goals. Gamification often engages and motivates learners, while game-based education teaches certain content and skills. This is a very simplified definition and doesn’t oppose Gamification versus Game-based learning in the educational context. You need to use different tools based on your audience, learning context, and available “levers.”

- Gamification can be used in various contexts, while game-based learning is typically used in educational contexts.
- Gamification is often used to increase engagement and motivation, while game-based learning is often used to improve learning outcomes.
- Gamification works better for “non-gamers” and enterprise areas, while game-based learning is excellent for kids or gamers.
- Gamification works better with formal education and is more flexible when the curriculum changes often, game-based learning has a wide area of usage in informal and non-formal education.

These are just points that got into my mind while I was writing this post. What else I’ve missed?
