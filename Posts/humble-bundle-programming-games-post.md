If youâ€™re looking for a fun and engaging way to sharpen your programming skills, this Humble Bundle is a must! ðŸŽ®ðŸ’»  

The *New Year, New You: Programming Games* bundle features some of the best programming-themed games, including *Learning Factory* and *while True: learn()* from my friends at Luden.io. These gems, along with classics like *EXAPUNKS*, *SHENZHEN I/O*, and *7 Billion Humans*, make it a perfect collection for both coding enthusiasts and curious learners.  

Sadly, Iâ€™ve already played them allâ€”but if you havenâ€™t, this bundle is a steal! Dive into the world of code, puzzles, and creativity.
