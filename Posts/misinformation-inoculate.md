 Misinformation is a huge problem in today's society. It's easy for people to be duped by facts they don't know or understand, and this can lead them to harmful decisions if left unchecked. The best way to combat this is to inoculate people with the knowledge of how manipulative news works. The article explains how such "inoculation" works and how it can be used to combat misinformation. I would like to see more of this in schools and universities because kids and students are uniquely vulnerable when engaging online. It is essential that education on this topic happens at a young age so that people are better equipped to deal with the online world.
