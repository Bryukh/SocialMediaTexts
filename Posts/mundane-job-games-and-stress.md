# Mundane Job Games as Stress Relief Games

Recent studies have shown that stress relief games can help to improve mental health and well-being. Stress relief games are video games designed to help people relax and relieve stress. Usually, those games look like some kind of meditation application. However, what about another way to get rid of the stress through mundane job tasks, but as a videogame?

## What are Mundane Job Games, and how do they work

Mundane Job Games are video games that simulate the experience of performing a mundane or repetitive task. The most popular examples are farm simulator games, in which players manage a virtual farm, and worker placement games, in which players take on the role of workers in a factory or office. While they may not be as exciting as traditional video games, Mundane Job Games can be surprisingly addictive, thanks to their simple mechanics and gentle learning curve. In addition, they can provide a welcome respite from the stress of everyday life, offering a chance to relax and unwind while still exercising your brain.

## The benefits of playing Mundane Job Games

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of playing so-called “mundane job games.” These are games that simulate activities that are generally considered to be boring or tedious, such as truck driving or household chores. While this may seem like a counterintuitive way to spend one’s leisure time, there are several benefits to playing these types of games. First, they can provide a welcome change of pace from more fast-paced or action-oriented games. Secondly, they can relieve stress and take one’s mind off everyday worries and concerns. Finally, they can be a distraction from real-world problems, providing a much-needed respite from the challenges of daily life. There is clear value in playing mundane job games, whether used for amusement or stress relief.
