I’ve always been drawn to indie games—they offer a creativity and charm that AAA titles often can’t match. So, I’ve decided to experiment with my gaming habits based on advice I heard from an indie game dev channel. 

Here are my personal gaming rules for the next few months:
1️⃣ No freemium games.  
2️⃣ No competitive multiplayer games.  

Now, don’t get me wrong — I’ve enjoyed both of these genres in the past. But recently, I’ve found myself craving a more peaceful gaming experience. Freemium games often feel like work with their dailies, weeklies, and FOMO-inducing events, while competitive multiplayer games can bring unwanted stress and toxicity.  

This experiment isn’t about rejecting these games entirely but redefining what “gaming for myself” means. Of course, I’ll still dive into them for research purposes, but as a developer, I need to separate work from play. My goal? I want to rediscover the pure joy of gaming I had before entering the game dev world.  

Let’s see how it goes.
