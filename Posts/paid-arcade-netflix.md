I've been exploring mobile gaming options as part of my experiment to avoid freemium and competitive games. My main contenders are Premium paid games, Apple Arcade, and Netflix Games. After a week of testing, here's my quick take:

1️⃣ **Premium Games**:  
 These include free games but unlock full content through a purchase. Sadly, this category feels underwhelming in mobile stores. I've already played Many PC ports or titles, lacking a true mobile-native touch. I'm holding off until my mobile gamepad returns to give these another try.  

2️⃣ **Apple Arcade**:  
 A mixed bag. Some titles feel like freemium games with monetization stripped out, leaving them a bit… incomplete. That said, gems like *Grindstone*, *Balatro*, and *Vampire Survivors* make it worthwhile. But honestly, I could just buy these games individually, right?

3️⃣ **Netflix Games**:  
 Surprisingly, this is my current favorite. It offers mobile-native gems like *Monument Valley* (1, 2, and 3), classic hits like *World of Goo*, and intriguing new titles like *The Case of the Golden Idol*.  

I'll continue exploring this "freemium detox" journey. Let me know if there are other interesting mobile game services or must-try paid touch-exclusive games! I'm still nostalgic for *Infinity Blade*—that game was a masterpiece.
