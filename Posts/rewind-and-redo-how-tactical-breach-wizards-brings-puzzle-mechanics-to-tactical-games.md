Rewind and Redo: How Tactical Breach Wizards Brings Puzzle Mechanics to Tactical Games

This weekend’s game is Tactical Breach Wizards. I’m not going to dive into a full review here, but if you’re a fan of puzzles, tactical games, and a delightfully crazy narrative, this game might be for you. While it looks like a standard tactical game, similar to XCOM, Tactical Breach Wizards offers something unique that feels more like a puzzle experience, along the lines of Into the Breach. Here’s why.

Unlike many tactical games, Tactical Breach Wizards uses deterministic rules, meaning there’s no randomness involved. This design choice, combined with features like infinite rewinds, foresight options, special goals, and handcrafted levels, turns the game into a true puzzle experience. Sure, you can approach it purely as a tactical game, but the puzzle mechanics encourage you to plan, try, and replay until you master each challenge.

Let’s talk a bit more about the rewind mechanic. I’ve been enjoying other games with similar “undo” features, like Monster Expedition and A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build. These games, inspired by “Sokoban-style” puzzles, allow you to undo your last moves, encouraging experimentation without the fear of failure. I love this feature because it promotes trying out different strategies, learning from mistakes, and going again—something that’s also highly effective in educational settings. Plus, the rewind mechanic takes a lot of the stress out of puzzle games, making them perfect for a morning warm-up or a relaxing evening activity.

Tactical Breach Wizards blends tactical and puzzle mechanics in a way that keeps players strategizing, rewinding, and replaying. It’s a unique experience for anyone who loves combining logic with tactics. But what about you? Do you enjoy games with rewind features, or do you prefer the thrill of high-stakes, no-turning-back gameplay? How do you feel about puzzle elements in tactical games—do they enhance the experience or make it too predictable? Share your thoughts in the comments below!
