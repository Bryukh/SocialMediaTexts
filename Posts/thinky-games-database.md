I love websites that collect and store data about games, and today, I came across Thinky Games. It's a site that focuses on "thinky" gamesâ€”puzzle-heavy, curiosity-driven titles that really make you think. If you're into challenging, strategy-based games that push you to discover hidden gems, this is definitely worth checking out. They even have a newsletter, which I'm curious about (though I haven't tried it yet). Huge respect for the team behind itâ€”so much effort goes into maintaining these resources!
