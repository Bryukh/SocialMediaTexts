This Monday, after spending the whole weekend playing, I’m excited to bring you a new game recommendation: Zet Zillions! It’s a fresh roguelike deckbuilder with unique mechanics and some quirky twists. First, the art style is reminiscent of Gurren Lagann, giving it a vibrant, over-the-top anime feel. Second, the narrative is a hilarious satire of Warhammer 40k. And third – your ship is a planet, and you battle sentient planets and stars! Sounds wild? Trust me, it looks even crazier, and it's one of the rare games where I found myself reading every bit of dialogue, laughing nonstop.

On the gameplay side, the game introduces interesting mechanics like card fusion, which adds incredible depth to strategy and builds. The map movement is similar to FTL, where you can move back and forth, but there’s always a BIG EVIL pushing you toward your goal.

Yes, I’m biased as a longtime fan of roguelike deck builders ever since Slay the Spire, but even if you’re not into this genre, I highly recommend trying Zet Zillions. The art and narrative alone are worth it!
