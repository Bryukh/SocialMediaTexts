Timothy Cain recently published a new video about matching your project with your team, and it resonated deeply with my experience in game development. I completely agree that the perfect alignment between your project and your team is a rare luxury. Timothy compares it with the movie industry, where directors can handpick their teams. Unfortunately, we often don't have that kind of control in the game industry.

I've worked on projects where we tried to adapt the team to fit the project, and while this can work if your team is super flexible, it still has its limits. I've been on projects that started with a "dream team," but as development progressed, people left, new members joined, and the perfect match was suddenly gone. Like Timothy, I believe that in these situations, you need to adapt your project to leverage your team's strengths.

Yes, tough decisions must be made, and sometimes you have to "kill your darlings"‚Äîthose cool ideas that don't fit anymore. But it's better to make these adjustments than to push forward with poorly implemented mechanics that could sink the whole project. Adapt, be flexible, and make the most of the tools you have.

Whether you're just taking your first steps in game development or an industry veteran reflecting on past choices, I highly recommend this video.
