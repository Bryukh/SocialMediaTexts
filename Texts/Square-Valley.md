I can't stand to tell you about one of my favorite mobile puzzle games -- Square Valley. This game caught my attention with bright art; however, I didn't expect such a deep ruleset with infinite combinations of tilesets. The puzzles can be challenging. However, this is a rare example of a game that can take a relaxing role. It helped me recently when I was trying to take a break from the madness that happened around me. 

The game is based on world-building. You are given different types of tiles, such as houses, trees, farms, animals, etc. Each tile has unique characteristics that will be scored differently. When you open up Square Valley, you'll first see a very colorful and inviting world. The game challenges you to place different tiles to create houses, trees, farms, animals, and more. Each tile has its own unique characteristics, which will be scored accordingly. You'll also be placing roads, rivers, fences, and more to connect all your tiles together. The journey begins with the creation of rivers and roads and then moves on to the construction of plateaus, lakes, and even islands!

It's no easy task, but the game is extremely rewarding. Not only will you be able to educate yourself on different tile placements, but you'll also have a lot of fun doing it. I highly recommend Square Valley to anyone looking for a unique and challenging puzzle game.
