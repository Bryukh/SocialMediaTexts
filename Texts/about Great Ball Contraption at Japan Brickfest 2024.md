Hacker News introduced me to the "Great Ball Contraption"â€”a series of Lego machines transporting small balls in mind-blowing ways. Iâ€™ve just added a new category to my life: educational procrastination. Itâ€™s engineering ecstasy, educational, and oddly relaxing. Procrastination isnâ€™t badâ€”your brain needs a break too! Now, I can loop these videos in the background while working for endless engineer dopamine hits. Seriously, if you love building, Lego, or The Incredible Machine game, this is a must-watch! Bewareâ€”itâ€™s addictive for engineers. Youâ€™ve been warned!
