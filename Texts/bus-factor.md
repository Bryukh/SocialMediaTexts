Several years ago, I learned about the term “bus factor”—the number of people on a team who could be hit by a metaphorical bus before a project grinds to a halt. Back then, one of my colleagues jokingly called me a “bus factor of 1,” and I didn’t think much of it.
Looking back on my career, especially working in small and medium-sized teams, I see how often we unknowingly operated with a bus factor of 1 in key areas of expertise. Health is unpredictable, and game development is fast-paced and frequently chaotic. Relying too much on one person is a risk we can’t afford to ignore.
Here’s what I’ve learned:
- Share your knowledge.
- Let others take over your tasks.
- Encourage your juniors.
- Delegate wherever possible.
Being “the most important” and irreplaceable isn’t a badge of honor—it’s a constant source of stress and a barrier to taking much-needed breaks.
What’s your take on the bus factor in your field? Have you experienced or mitigated it in your teams?
