Epic Games and Coursera have launched the "Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate," an 8-course series for beginners. While certificates may not guarantee a job, they can be useful in surprising ways, like for visas (true story!). Even though it's beginner-focused, I'm taking it for a few reasons: to improve my teaching skills as an educational game designer, to learn more Unreal Engine as a technical designer, and to fill any gaps in my game design knowledge. I love learning, so I'll use smart strategies to focus on my weak points. I'll share my thoughts once I complete it!

Starting the "Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate" on Coursera. It’s beginner-friendly, but I’m taking it to improve my Unreal Engine and teaching skills. [Link to course]

It’s also a good opportunity to fill gaps in my game design knowledge and focus on areas I need to improve.

I’ll use this course strategically—targeting weak spots and learning what’s most useful. I’ll share my thoughts once I’ve finished. #GameDesign #GameDev #UnrealEngine #Learning
