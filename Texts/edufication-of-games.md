Do you know such a thing as the Edufication of games? I think you are familiar with Gamification. Gamification is using game elements in non-game contexts and adding gaming practices in activities such as education. The main point is that Gamification is an additional layer, and removing it won't break the core product.

So playing recently different education games, I've noticed that some of them are not game-based learning but eduficated games when an educational mechanic isn't in the core loop even. So you remove that Edufication layer, and the games may change a little but still remain the same in the core. That's the main difference between game-based learning and edufication in games. I don't want to say it's a bad practice -- vice versus. I think it's a good way to create educational games based on existing successful and familiar for players/students titles.
