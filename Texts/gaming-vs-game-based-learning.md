# 5 Differences Between Gaming and Game-Based Learning

Every game is educational. Maybe it’s not obvious for most games, especially for video games however, if you look carefully, you can always find some skills or knowledge that you can get through gameplay. So does it means that Gaming is the same as Game-Based Learning?

The answer is no, they are not the same. Video games are educational, but most are not created with education in mind. On the other hand, Game-Based Learning is a method where games are used for educational purposes. So what’s the difference?

The first and most important difference is the goals of the game creators. The primary goal of playing a video game is to have fun and experience positive emotions. The primary goal of game-based learning is education and knowledge acquisition. Games can be used for education, but not all of them are created specifically for that purpose.

The second difference that came to mind is game mechanics. The mechanics of video games are created to support the fun and make sure that players have a good time. The mechanics of game-based learning are created to support education and knowledge acquisition. This means that game-based learning games will often be more complex than entertainment video games.

The third difference is in the feedback loops. In video games, the feedback loops are designed to keep players engaged and to make sure they are having fun. The feedback loops in game-based learning are designed to help learners understand the material and to provide them with opportunities to practice what they have learned.

The fourth difference is in the player experience. Video games are meant to be enjoyed, and players should feel like they are in control of the game. Game-based learning, on the other hand, is meant to be educational, and players should feel like they are learning something new.

The fifth and final difference is social interaction. In video games, players often interact with other players in order to have fun. In game-based learning, players often interact with other learners in order to learn from each other.

So, while Gaming can be educational and Game-based Learning can be entertaining, they are not the same. The goals, mechanics, feedback loops, player experience, and social interaction of the two are different. Consider these differences when choosing which type of game to use for your school.
