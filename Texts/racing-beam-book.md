Have finished the [Racing Beam](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539760/racing-the-beam/) book on the weekend. I think it's the first platform studies type of books that I've read. The book focuses on the technical aspect of the platform and there are many details about the game development process for the Atari 2600. The author tried to explain the technical details in a way that is easy to understand for non-technical people. However, I think it's still would be hard to understand without game development or software engineering background. 
The book is full by examples of interesting tricks and hacks that the developers used to make the games work on the Atari 2600. For engineers it's like reading an adventure story with unexpected twists and turns. I'm not sure if it's was a problem with my version of the ebook or the book needs more screenshots and diagrams. I think it would be easier to understand the technical details. I had to google about some of games to refresh my memory. Anyway, it's a solid book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the technical side of the video games and the history of the game development.
