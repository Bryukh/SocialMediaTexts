Designing a game that is both educational and fun can take time and effort. On the one hand, you want to ensure that the game is entertaining enough to keep players engaged, while on the other hand, you also need to ensure that the game is teaching them something. This is where tutorials come in.

Tutorials, when done poorly, are terrible. They're immersion-breaking, take up time the player could be used to play your game, and often fail to teach the player anything. When done properly, however, tutorials can significantly improve a player's experience with your game.

Found this article a helpful read. However, it's important to keep in mind that tutorials are not just for new players. They can be used to teach new mechanics to players who have been playing for a while. This is especially important for games with many mechanics and constantly adding new ones. 

What other tips or resources do you have for designing good tutorials? Let me know in the comments below!
